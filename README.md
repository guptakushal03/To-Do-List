# To-Do List with Firebase

This is a simple **To-Do List** app that uses **Firebase Realtime Database** to store and manage tasks. Users can add new tasks, and once they are added, they can also delete them by clicking on the task. The app automatically updates in real-time as tasks are added or removed.

## Features

- **Real-time updates**: The list is updated in real-time across all clients.
- **Delete tasks**: Click on a task to delete it from the list.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Tasks are stored and synced using Firebase.

2. **Delete Tasks**: Click on any task in the list to remove it from the Firebase database.

3. **Real-time Sync**: The list automatically updates in real-time when a task is added or removed.
